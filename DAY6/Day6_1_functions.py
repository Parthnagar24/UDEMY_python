#A function in its simplest form is just a wrapper name for a block of code. You give it name and then when you call the function by that name, all the code within the function block will be executed. It can help us save time and reduce repeated code.

#Defining a new Function
#def <function name>():
 #   print("Hello")
    # Do something else
